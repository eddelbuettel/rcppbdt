Description: Access to Boost Date_Time functionality for dates,
 durations (both for days and date time objects), time zones, and 
 posix time ('ptime') is provided by using 'Rcpp modules'. The 
 posix time implementation can support high-resolution of up to 
 nano-second  precision by using 96 bits (instead of 64 with R)
 to present a 'ptime' object (but this needs recompilation with
 a #define set).
